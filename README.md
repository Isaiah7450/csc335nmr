# NMR

This project stores my code for the CSC 335 NMR project.

## Compiling

Type `make`, and the program will compile itself. The output will be `nmr.out`.

## Running

The program will read in the program options from standard input using the
format specified in the project description. It is recommended to use file
redirection (like shown below) instead of specifying the options from
the keyboard.

Example Usage: `nmr.out < nmr.in`.
